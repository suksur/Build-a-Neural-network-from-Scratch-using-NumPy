    "In this notebook we will work through a code example of a simple and shallow neural net. Before doing so, we should consider the *business use-case*. Our scenario will look at house price prediction, is there a business use case here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the ability to use AI-powered prediction is a real advantage. If done well, an estate agent that uses accurate predictions for the properties they deal with has a big advantage over an estate agent that uses human experts to make these predicitons, the AI-powered company can operate much more efficiently, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "A new property is brought to the estate agent, a form describing the property is filled out and entered into a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The traditional company must then pay a human expert to make an initial price estimate, this can take time and estimates can be affected by human error or even the mood of that person on that day. If the expert is unfamiliar with the area the house is located in, or typically deals with smaller houses, their prediction take longer (costing the estate agent more money), and be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The AI-powered company has a program that automatically feeds this new data into the house prediction neural net, returning an estimate almost instantaneously. The neural net can do this for millions of new houses almost every second, the costs of running this neural net are minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already we can see the potential of something like this, however, it must be done carefully and a human may still need provide a final estimate. There is the case of *Zillow*, a real-estate marketplace that used AI to power a rapid home buying and reselling tool called *\"Zillow Offers\"*. Zillow Offers was their AI-powered house price estimation tool, that provided start-to-end house pricing with little human oversight, unfortunately this turned out very poorly for Zillow who quickly shut down Zillow Offers, wrote off $569M worth of homes, and laid off 25% of its staff [\\[source\\]](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-happened-at-zillow-how-a-prized-real-estate-site-lost-at-ibuying/).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, other companies such as Opendoor and Offerpad seem to have implemented AI powered price estimates with much more success [\\[source\\]](https://www.protocol.com/manuals/proptechs-big-moment/ibuyer-opendoor-offerpad-zillow), showing that this approach can be implemented successfully, if done right."

We will cover this in more depth in future chapters, but the reason for this is that our network is unable to represent complex relationships with only a few weights. However, when we take the same concepts discussed above and apply them across multiple layers with more neurons and adjustable weights/biases more complex relationships can be represented. "
