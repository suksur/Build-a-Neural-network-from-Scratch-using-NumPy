# Build-a-Neural-network-from-Scratch-using-NumPy


Overview


A neural network is a set of algorithms that aim to recognize the underlying pattern in
the data. These are subsets of Machine learning and the heart of deep learning
algorithms. Neural networks are inspired by the working of the human brain.
Neural networks are applied in many real-life applications like self-driving cars, speech
recognition, medical diagnosis, and many more.

In this project, we will be building a neural network from scratch just by using NumPy
only and not by using any deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow or PyTorch. The
built neural network will predict the price of the house in Pune, India. This project will
also give you an in-depth idea about the working of neural networks.
